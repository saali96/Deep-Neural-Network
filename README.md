# Deep Neural Network


This repository contains a deep neural network implemented using a long short-term memory (LSTM) and dense layers, trained on the Rossmann store sales data from the Kaggle competition. The program includes preprocessing of the data, visualization of the training process, saving the trained model, testing on unseen data, and evaluation of the model's performance. The program is designed to achieve strong predictive performance on this challenging time series forecasting task.
